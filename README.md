# ERIDANUS CUSTOM SKINS

###### This repository contains a series of custom skins designed exclusively for Eridanus by AptFury/Blake. Additional development may be done to produce a wider diversity of skin options, all of which will be separated into their respective folders. You can find more information on each of those below if they are developed. At this time, current plans only include the production one one (1) dark skin and one (1) light skin that users can swap between at their discretion. If more are added, they will be catalogued by name and info in this file with their skin code in the corresponding folder.

These skins are not to be only and exclusively by the approved parties: Destiny (client), Eridanus (site), and AptFury/Blake (developer). If you would like to use these files to help assist in your own skin development, please reach out to me and I'll happily let you fork the project or create a branch a fork for you with the relavant skin you're wanting to work wih!
